# Lab1 - XYZ AI folder structure

Welcome to the first lab on working with XYZ spreadsheet data structures for AI workflows!

We will create a simple folder structure to organize spreadsheet cells in local files, making it easier to reference and process data for AI applications.

Experiment 1: Create Folder Structure manually

1. Create the following file and folder structure under the Hugo "content/labs" directory:

lab1/exp1/tab1/row1/cell1/index.md
